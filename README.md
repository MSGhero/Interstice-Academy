Code for the Newgrounds Festival Server's blind date jam

This isn't gonna include any of the art or music, since many of them are uploading to their own NG accounts. It IS gonna include ~~300~~ some handmade dialogue files, which I'm never doing again. ** 300 is way too many and Github is being annoying, so however many are there now is enough.

DialogueSystem.hx has all of the logic for the main game.
