You notice your date lacks any hands, so you place the Dark Chocolate Pudding on the table.
There is no discourse to be had between you and Artistically Rendered Sphere. 
As you sit in silence, it occurs to you your date lacks a mouth. 
You also realize you’ve never seen Artistically Rendered Sphere eat anything, for that matter.
Does Artistically Rendered Sphere eat? You can’t say for sure...
You get the impression this was probably not the best of gifts for your date.
