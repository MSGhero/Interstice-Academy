You ask Artistically Rendered Sphere about the geometric package.
Artistically Rendered Sphere continues to sit proudly beneath the shadows of the tree. 
The formal nature of your question almost makes you feel silly as Artistically Rendered Sphere offers no reply.
The shadows beneath Artistically Rendered Sphere slowly fade away into nothingness as the lighting of the sky above grows more dim.
As this takes place, any feelings of silliness or hesitation on your part are quickly assuaged
You almost feel beckoned, if not subtly welcomed by your date, to take the package.
