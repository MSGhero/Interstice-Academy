You notice your date lacks any sort of eyes or eye sockets, so you place the Eye of Limitless Beholding haphazardly atop Artistically Rendered Sphere.
The otherwise perfect aesthetic of Artistically Rendered Sphere is now offset by this ironically rather unsightly item.
You feel like youâ€™ve somehow wronged your date...
The Eye of Limitless Beholding rolls off of Artistically Rendered Sphere and lands on the table.
