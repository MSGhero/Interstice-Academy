You decide to do nothing after exchanging gifts, sitting idly opposite your date.
As you stare at Artistically Rendered Sphere, you notice that together, along with your table, the two of you have cast a very impressive shadow over The Bowery.
Though you yourself are not rendered in the same way, you recognize you are both quite picturesque in this moment.
Indeed, your respective stoicism only seems to be further compounded by the other’s.
Words do not always need to be exchanged when in one another’s company.
As the time passes, you find this more and more to be the case.
Though you do not outwardly show it, you feel a true mutual understanding between you and Artistically Rendered Sphere.
Perhaps this marks the beginning of something beautiful...
Perhaps... you two may even share an artistically rendered future as human and sphere...
