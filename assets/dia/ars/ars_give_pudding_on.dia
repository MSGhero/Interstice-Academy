You notice your date lacks any hands, so you place the Eye of Limitless Beholding haphazardly atop Artistically Rendered Sphere.
The otherwise perfect aesthetic of Artistically Rendered Sphere is now offset by savory, delicious treat.
It occurs to you your date lacks a mouth. 
You also realize you’ve never seen Artistically Rendered Sphere eat something, for that matter.
Does Artistically Rendered Sphere eat? You can’t say for sure...
You feel like you’ve somehow wronged your date with this gift.
Eventually, the Dark Chocolate Pudding container slides off of Artistically Rendered Sphere and lands on the table.
